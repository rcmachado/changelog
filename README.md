`changelog` is a command-line application to read and manipulate
`CHANGELOG.md` files that follows the [keepachangelog.com][] spec.

It can normalize the file (`fmt`), create a release (`release`) and
show a specific version (`show`). See [Usage](#usage) for details.

$ changelog init --compare-url=https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/compare/abcdef...1234

# Show latest release number
$ changelog latest

```

## Installation

### Linux and macOS

The easiest way to install it is to download the [latest version][]
from GitHub releases.

There are precompiled binaries for macOS and Linux.

### Source

Clone the repository and build the executable:

```bash
make build
```

This will generate a `changelog` binary that can be copied to `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
cp changelog /usr/local/bin
```

```

### init

Outputs a changelog with only preamble and Unreleased version to standard output. You can specify a filename using `--output/-o` flag:

```bash
$ touch CHANGELOG.md
$ changelog init -o CHANGELOG.md --compare-url https://github.com/cucumber/changelog/compare/abcdef...HEAD
Changelog file 'CHANGELOG.md' created.
```

### fmt

Normalize file format (see [Formatting](#formatting) for the specific
transformation applied):

```bash
changelog fmt
```

### show

Show what will be in the next release:

```bash
changelog show Unreleased
```

Show the change log for a specific version:

```bash
changelog show 1.2.3
```

### release

Create a new release:

```bash
changelog release 1.2.4
```

If you use a prefix for git tags, specify a tag format:

```bash
changelog release --tag-format "v%s" 1.2.4
```

### Formatting

`fmt` command normalizes the changelog file. The idea is to always have
the same output, no matter how messy the file is. Right now it doesn't
do much, but the plan is to evolve it as a kind of `go fmt` for
changelogs.

Currently, the following transformations are applied:

- Sections are sorted (eg. Added, Changed, etc)
- Version links are put at the bottom of the file
- List bullet is always `-`
